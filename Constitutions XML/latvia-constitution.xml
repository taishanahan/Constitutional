    <body><preamble>PREAMBLE The people of Latvia, in freely elected Constitutional Assembly, have
            adopted the following State Constitution: The State of Latvia, proclaimed on 18 November
            1918, has been established by uniting historical Latvian lands and on the basis of the
            unwavering will of the Latvian nation to have its own State and its inalienable right of
            self-determination in order to guarantee the existence and development of the Latvian
            nation, its language and culture throughout the centuries, to ensure freedom and promote
            welfare of the people of Latvia and each individual. The people of Latvia won their
            State in the War of Liberation. They consolidated the system of government and adopted
            the Constitution in a freely elected Constitutional Assembly. The people of Latvia did
            not recognise the occupation regimes, resisted them and regained their freedom by
            restoring national independence on 4 May 1990 on the basis of continuity of the State.
            They honour their freedom fighters, commemorate victims of foreign powers, condemn the
            Communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes and their crimes. Latvia as democratic, socially
            responsible and national state is based on the rule of law and on respect for human
            dignity and freedom; it recognises and protects fundamental human rights and respects
            ethnic minorities. The people of Latvia protect their sovereignty, national
            independence, territory, territorial integrity and democratic system of government of
            the State of Latvia. Since ancient times, the identity of Latvia in the European
            cultural space has been shaped by Latvian and Liv traditions, Latvian folk wisdom, the
            Latvian language, universal human and Christian values. Loyalty to Latvia, the Latvian
            language as the only official language, freedom, equality, solidarity, justice, honesty,
            work ethic and family are the foundations of a cohesive society. Each individual takes
            care of oneself, oneâ€™s relatives and the common good of society by acting responsibly
            toward other people, future generations, the environment and nature. While acknowledging
            its equal status in the international community, Latvia protects its national interests
            and promotes sustainable and democratic development of a united Europe and the world.
            God, bless Latvia!</preamble>
