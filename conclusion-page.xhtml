                   <p>Although liberties under our individual rights tag was
                       higher than 50 %, the freedom house score graph directly compares each country’s mentions of individual freedoms (which are mostly characterized as general rights that fall underneath a citizen’s right to governmental protection) to determine if each country’s current sociopolitical environment supports that reasoning. Although the percentage of the right to protest is already low, amongst other rights implying the right to outwardly oppose against the government, this displays that post-former states have generally met the criteria required to be considered free. For instance, free and independent media’s status has been labelled to fall under “strict, Soviet-style controls” (Cepoi, 2021), with Russia and Belarus elucidating those restrictions. Although the Russian constitutions guarantee freedom of expression, it recieved a 1 out of 6 for media protection on Freedom House due to legislative restrictions on both mass media enterprises and online publications(Freedom House, 2023). <em>This reveals that although an analysis of each category of individual rights can be explicitly mentioned in this first chapter, this must be compared to their real-world applications to determine if the current government actually reflects similar sentiments. </em></p>
