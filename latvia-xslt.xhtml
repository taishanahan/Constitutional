      <p class="preamble">PREAMBLE The people of Latvia, in freely elected Constitutional Assembly, have
         adopted the following State Constitution: The State of Latvia, proclaimed on 18 November
         1918, has been <span class="nationalism">established by uniting historical Latvian lands and on the basis of the
            unwavering will of the Latvian nation</span> to have <span class="soveriegnty">its own State and its inalienable right of
            self-determination in order to guarantee the existence and development of the Latvian
            nation</span>, <span class="native">its language</span> and <span class="nationalism">culture</span> throughout the centuries, to ensure <span class="liberty">freedom</span> and <span class="peace">promote
            welfare of the people of Latvia</span> and each individual. The people of Latvia won their 
         State in the War of Liberation. <span class="gov">They consolidated the system of government and adopted
            the Constitution in a freely elected Constitutional Assembly</span>. <span class="international">The people of Latvia did
            not recognise the occupation regimes</span>, resisted them and <span class="soveriegnty">regained their freedom by
            restoring national independence on 4 May 1990 on the basis of continuity of the State</span>.
         <span class="nationalism">They honour their freedom fighters</span>, <span class="international">commemorate victims of foreign powers, condemn the
            Communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes and their crimes</span>. Latvia as <span class="gov">democratic, socially
            responsible and national state is based on the rule of law</span> and on <span class="liberty">respect for human
            dignity and freedom</span>; it recognises and protects <span class="liberty">fundamental human rights</span> and <span class="racial-equality">respects
            ethnic minorities</span>. The people of Latvia protect <span class="soveriegnty">their sovereignty, national
            independence, territory, territorial integrity</span> and <span class="gov">democratic system of government of
            the State of Latvia.</span> Since ancient times, <span class="nationalism">the identity of Latvia in the European
            cultural space has been shaped by Latvian and Liv traditions, Latvian folk wisdom,</span> <span class="native">the
            Latvian language</span>, universal human and <span class="neutral">Christian values</span>. <span class="nationalism">Loyalty to Latvia</span>,<span class="native"> the Latvian
            language as the only official language</span>, <span class="liberty">freedom, equality, solidarity, justice</span>, honesty,
         work ethic and family are the foundations of a cohesive society. Each individual takes
         care of oneself, oneâ€™s relatives and the common good of society by acting responsibly
         toward other people, <span class="nationalism">future generations</span>, the environment and nature. <span class="international">While acknowledging
            its equal status in the international community, Latvia protects its national interests
            and promotes sustainable and democratic development of a united Europe and the world</span>.
         <span class="neutral">God, bless Latvia!</span></p>
