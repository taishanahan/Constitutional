<!-- You can't put whatever you want. Same language as xml, but there is also a  standard here. You have to stay within those confines -->
<!-- Directory and folder are the same thing, we'll use directory more. CSS was designed to style html. Since html is from xml, CSS is also designed
    like a tree. Any rule we declare for an element in CSS will apply to all descendent elements if they're not superceded by a lower-level rule.-->
