        <h1>An Analysis of the Constitutions of Former Soviet Union States</h1>
        <section class="one">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>This website presents our project that explores the constitutions of the 15 different states of the former Soviet Union. 
                Using document analysis, we sought to compare and contrast the preamble and first chapter of 15 constitutions. We looked for
                similar themes and concepts that are common among constitutions, such as nationalism, individual rights, and soveriegnty. The 
                ultimate goal was to see what the most important information to include was for different states. </p>
