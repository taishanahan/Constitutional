            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>This website presents our project that explores the constitutions of the 15 different
                states of the former Soviet Union. Using document analysis, we sought to compare and
                contrast the preamble and first chapter of 15 constitutions. We looked for similar
                themes and concepts that are common among constitutions, such as nationalism,
                individual rights, and soveriegnty. The ultimate goal was to see what the most
                important information to include was for different states. </p>
