            <h2>Background</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>The fall of the Soviet Union, a hegemonic cultural and political power in Europe and
                Asia, produced a veritable explosion of states that rose from its ashes. These
                fifteen states, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
                Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,
                and Uzbekistan preceded their socialists republics and are internationally
                considered the successors of their corresponding Union Republics and not the Soviet
                Union. The three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, prioritized integrating
                into the international community, which clashed with the near-total disengagement
                with the Russian-dominated post-Soviet sphere, and eventually joined the European
                Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The forms of
                governments of the new states ranges from dominant-party to parlimentan to unitary
                presidential systems. <!--Russian President Vladimir
                Putin has still dictated the Eastern region (Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine) to be
                under Russia’s “sphere of influence."--> Economic recessions that
                followed the USSR’s dissolution marked a period of the fall of the Gosplan, the
                state planning agency responsible for economic planning, and the rapid embracement
                of market economic policies. This resulted in “shock therapy” policies in the early
                1990s, where trade liberalization, price liberalization, and privatization triggered
                a drop in GDP and budget cuts towards social programs like education and healthcare.
                Therefore, some common trends found in the original constitutions drafted for each
                state was molded by this acceptance of a liberal economy, with instituions like the
                central bank and private property explicitly mentioned as independent to the state
                institions. Pairing this with social policies, privatization and liberalization
                formed the foundations of citizens’ liberties within each constitution. Our
                analysis, then, is an evaluation of the commitments and prioties within the first
                sections of the constitutions of these post-Soviet republics and, in turn, how those
                commitments have been upheld in the following decades.</p>

                body of text so as to make data collection informative and robust, but also
                efficient.</p>
