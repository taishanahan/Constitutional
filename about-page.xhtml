            <h2>Background</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>The former soviet rebuilt countries emerged as independent soveirgn states after the
                dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. With 15 states, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
                Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova,
                Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan preceded their socialists
                republics and are internationally considered the successors of their corresponding
                Union Republics and not the Soviet Union. The three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia,
                Lithuania, prioritized integrating into the international community, which clashed
                with the near-total disengagement with the Russian-dominated post-Soviet sphere, and
                eventually joined the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
                (NATO). The forms of governments of the new states varies from dominant-party to
                parlimentan to unitary presidential systems, however, Russian President Vladimir
                Putin has still dictated the Eastern region (Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine) to be
                under Russia’s “sphere of influencer”. Economic recessions that followed the USSR’s
                dissolution marked a period of the fall of the Gosplan, the state planning agency
                responsible for economic planning, and the rapid embracement of market economic
                policies. This resulted in “shock therapy” policies in the early 1990s, where trade
                liberalization, price liberalization, and privatization triggered a drop in GDP and
                budget cuts towards social programs like education and healthcare. Therefore, some
                common trends found in the original constitutions drafted for each state was molded
                by this acceptance of a liberal economy, with instituions like the central bank and
                private property explicitly mentioned as independent to the state institions.
                Pairing this with social policies, privatization and liberalization formed the
                foundations of citizens’ liberties within each constitution.</p>
